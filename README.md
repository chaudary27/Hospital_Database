# 🏥 Hospital Management System (SQL Project)

This project is a database management system for a Hospital Management System (HMS), designed using SQL. It models patient records, doctor specializations, admissions, and provinces. I solved **52 SQL queries** to practice and explore real-world database operations.



## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to practice SQL queries using a structured database related to hospital data. It helps in gaining hands-on experience with:
- Database creation and normalization
- Writing optimized SQL queries
- Understanding data relationships (foreign keys, joins)
- Solving practical database challenges with real-world scenarios
