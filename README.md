# üè• Hospital Management System (SQL Project)

This project is a database management system for a Hospital Management System (HMS), designed using SQL. It models patient records, doctor specializations, admissions, and provinces. I solved **52 SQL queries** to practice and explore real-world database operations.



## üéØ Objective

The goal of this project is to practice SQL queries using a structured database related to hospital data. It helps in gaining hands-on experience with:
- Database creation and normalization
- Writing optimized SQL queries
- Understanding data relationships (foreign keys, joins)
- Solving practical database challenges with real-world scenarios

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- MySQL (or any compatible RDBMS)
- Git & GitHub

## üîç Query Levels

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Basic Level**
- Creating tables and inserting data
- Simple SELECT queries with conditions

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Intermediate Level**
- Complex SELECT queries with joins and GROUP BY
- Filtering and sorting data
- Date functions and aggregation

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Advanced Level**

## üìà Sample Query (Advanced)

```sql
SELECT province_name, COUNT(DISTINCT patient_id) AS total_patients
FROM patients
JOIN province_names ON patients.province_id = province_names.province_id
GROUP BY province_name
ORDER BY total_patients DESC;
